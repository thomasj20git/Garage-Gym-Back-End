I mainly just used the basic technolgies we learned in the homework. working on learning routes and adding a user controller to have a log in for people. wanted to make the fell of instagram almost with a bar on the bottom of the page that has buttons/links to other pages that you have. made the edit button/form a modal using usestate and showing. learning the heroku deployment and all of those connections were a real challenge for me in this project but i got everything working learned i had ip address local on my mongo server which had me stuck for a long time...really excited to keep adding to this project
